# Image Classification of Cats Using CNNs
## Description
Designed and trained two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify cat species from images, highlighting the evolution of CNN architecture performance. Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, and recall, showing how modern CNN techniques including deeper networks and residual learning as used in ResNet 50 outperform earlier architectures like LeNet 5, especially on high-resolution RGB images.
